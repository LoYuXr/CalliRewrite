After creating the `calli_rl` virtual environment, we need to make two corrections to the `tianshou` framework and the `shimmy` library.

### Modifying `tianshou/env/venvs.py`

Locate the `_patch_env_generator` function and modify the `patched` method as follows:


```python
def patched(env):
    import gym
    import packaging.version
    import shimmy

    gym_version = packaging.version.parse(gym.__version__)

    if gym_version >= packaging.version.parse("0.26.0"):
        return shimmy.GymV26CompatibilityV0(env=env)
    elif gym_version >= packaging.version.parse("0.22.0"):
        return shimmy.GymV21CompatibilityV0(env=env)  # Corrected to GymV21CompatibilityV0
```
### Modifying `shimmy/openai_gym_compatibility.py`

Locate the `step` method and replace its contents with the following code:


```python
from typing import Any, ActType, Tuple

def step(self, action: ActType) -> Tuple[Any, float, bool, bool, dict]:
    """Steps through the environment.

    Args:
        action: action to step through the environment with

    Returns:
        (observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)
    """
    reoc = self.gym_env.step(action)  # Modified here
    if len(reoc) == 5:
        obs, reward, terminate, truncate, info = reoc
        return (
            obs,
            reward,
            terminate,
            truncate,
            info,
        )
    
    obs, reward, done, info = reoc

    # Commented out rendering code (optional)
    # if self.render_mode is not None:
    #     self.render()

    return obs, reward, done, info
```
### Resolving "Unknown encoder 'libx264'" Error

If you encounter the error "Unknown encoder 'libx264'" while running the code, execute the following commands to uninstall and reinstall `ffmpeg` using `conda`:


```bash
conda uninstall ffmpeg
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```
These steps should address the necessary modifications to the `tianshou` and `shimmy` libraries, as well as resolve any issues with the `ffmpeg` encoder.
